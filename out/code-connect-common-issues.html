If you encounter issues, you may need to explicitly allow connections to <code>https://api.figma.com/</code>. If you have any feedback, please createa a <a href="https://github.com/figma/code-connect/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub issue</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="413-errors-due-to-too-large-uploads"><a class="hash-link" href="#413-errors-due-to-too-large-uploads" title="Direct link to heading"></a>413 errors due to too large uploads</h3><p>Please rerun with the <code>--batch-size</code> parameter. This will upload the Code Connect in batches of documents of batch_size length. We suggest starting with 50 and decreasing until converging on a size that works for your Code Connect.</p>
