# createVector

Creates a new, empty vector network with no vertices.

## Signature

### createVector(): VectorNode

## Remarks

By default, parented under `figma.currentPage`. Without setting additional properties, the vector has a bounding box but doesnâ€™t have any vertices. There are two ways to assign vertices to a vector node - [`vectorPaths`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/#vectorpaths) and [`setVectorNetworkAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/#setvectornetworkasync). Please refer to the documentation of those properties for more details.
