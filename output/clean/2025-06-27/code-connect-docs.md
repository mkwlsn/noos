# Introduction

Code Connect is a bridge between your codebase and Figma’s Dev Mode, connecting components in your repositories directly to components in your design files. When implemented, Code Connect generates custom code snippets for connected components, enhancing consistency for your developers. It’s easy to set up, easy to maintain, type-safe, and extensible.

##### important

Important: Code Connect is available on Organization and Enterprise plans and requires a Full or Dev seat to use.

## Leverage automation to connect design with code seamlessly

Use Figma’s Code Connect to make your design system easily accessible to your developers and create a shared source of truth for both the design and code elements.

Our Getting Started guide will walk you through the process of setting up Code Connect, using our interactive setup to automatically map components, and publishing your first components. [Getting Started with Code Connect →](/code-connect-docs/quickstart-guide/)

## Refine those mappings with a flexible API

Code Connect comes with support for different frameworks and languages. Our integration guides will walk you through the process of refining your components by mapping props and variants for:

- React (and React Native) →
- HTML (e.g. Web Components, Angular and Vue) →
- SwiftUI →
- Jetpack Compose →.

Button.figma.tsx```
import figma from '@figma/code-connect/react'figma.connect(Button, 'https://...', { props: { label: figma.string('Text Content'), disabled: figma.boolean('Disabled'), size: figma.enum('Size', { Large: 'large', Medium: 'medium', Small: 'small', }), }, example: ({ disabled, label, size }) => { return ( {label} ) },})
```

## Publish to Figma to make handoff a breeze

Once published, your components will be available in Figma’s Dev Mode, displaying the true-to-production code snippets from your design system instead of autogenerated code examples.
