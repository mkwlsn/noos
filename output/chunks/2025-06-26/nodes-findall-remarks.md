Nodes are included in back-to-front order. Parents always appear before their children, and children appear in same relative order before their children, and children appear in same relative order as in the [`children`](/plugin-docs/api/properties/nodes-children/) array.

This traversal method is known as ["pre-order traversal"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order_(NLR)).

Note that the node this method is called on is not included.

Example: find all nodes whose name is "Color":

```
const colors = figma.currentPage.findAll(n => n.name === "Color")
```##### caution

âš  Large documents in Figma can have tens of thousands of nodes. Be careful using this function as it could be very slow.
If you only need to search immediate children, it is much faster to call `node.children.filter(callback)` or `node.findChildren(callback)`.
Please refer to our [recommendations](/plugin-docs/accessing-document/#optimizing-traversals) for how to optimize document traversals.
