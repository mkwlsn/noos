# Introduction

Code Connect is a bridge between your codebase and Figma’s Dev Mode, connecting components in your repositories directly to components in your design files. When implemented, Code Connect generates custom code snippets for connected components, enhancing consistency for your developers. It’s easy to set up, easy to maintain, type-safe, and extensible.

##### important

Important: Code Connect is available on Organization and Enterprise plans and requires a Full or Dev seat to use.
