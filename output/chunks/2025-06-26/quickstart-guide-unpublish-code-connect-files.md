If there are any issues with your mappings or you need to detach a component for any reason, you can unpublish a Code Connect file. To unpublish a file, use:

```
npx figma connect unpublish --node=NODE_URL
```Where `NODE_URL` is the URL of a specific node in your design system file.

##### important

Important: If you don’t specify a node URL, Code Connect will unpublish all of your components defined in your Code Connect files directory. If you ever have questions about other configurations that can be run, use the `--help` flag to list all the available flags.

## Understand Code Connect files

After running the interactive setup, you’ll have a series of files named the following way:

```
component-name.figma.{tsx|kt|swift} (depending on framework)
```Where:

- `component-name` matches the name of the corresponding component in your codebase.
- `figma` indicates that the file is a Code Connect file.
- `tsx`, `kt`, or `swift` extension matches the framework used for the components. For example, if your codebase consists of React components, your Code Connect files use `tsx`.

If you didn’t set a directory for the files created by the interactive setup, your Code Connect files are located in alongside their matching components.

Here’s an example of a Code Connect file for a React component:

```
import React from "react"import { Button } from "../ui/primitives/Button/Button"import figma from "@figma/code-connect"/** * -- This file was auto-generated by Code Connect -- * `props` includes a mapping from Figma properties and variants to * suggested values. You should update this to match the props of your * code component, and update the `example` function to return the * code example you'd like to see in Figma */figma.connect( Button, "https://www.figma.com/design/Z1bRs3WFkOz26z5bzwtBbA?node-id=65%3A5", { props: { hasIconStart: figma.boolean("Has Icon Start"), iconStart: figma.instance("Icon Start"), hasIconEnd: figma.boolean("Has Icon End"), iconEnd: figma.instance("Icon End"), label: figma.string("Label"), variant: figma.enum("Variant", { Primary: "primary", Neutral: "neutral", Subtle: "subtle", }), // No matching props could be found for these Figma properties: // "state": figma.enum('State', { // "Default": "default", // "Hover": "hover", // "Disabled": "disabled" // }), // "size": figma.enum('Size', { // "Medium": "medium", // "Small": "small" // }) }, example: (props) => , },)
```This file was created by the interactive setup, using your choice for property mapping. The file includes the following sections:
