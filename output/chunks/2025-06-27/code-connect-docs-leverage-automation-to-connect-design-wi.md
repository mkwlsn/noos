Use Figma’s Code Connect to make your design system easily accessible to your developers and create a shared source of truth for both the design and code elements.

Our Getting Started guide will walk you through the process of setting up Code Connect, using our interactive setup to automatically map components, and publishing your first components. [Getting Started with Code Connect →](/code-connect-docs/quickstart-guide/)
