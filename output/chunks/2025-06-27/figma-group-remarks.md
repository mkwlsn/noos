This API is roughly the equivalent of pressing Ctrl-G/âŒ˜G in the editor, but groups the specified list of nodes rather than the current selection. You may still, of course, group the current selection by passing it as an argument:

Group nodes```
figma.group(figma.currentPage.selection, parent)
```

##### info

Why is there no `figma.createGroup()` function? It would create an empty group, and empty groups are not supported in Figma.

##### info

Why do we require `figma.group(...)` to specify the parent, rather let you call `parent.appendChild(group)` separately? It allows you to create the new group while keeping all the grouped layers in the same absolute x/y locations. The method `.appendChild` preserves the relative position of a node, so if you use `.appendChild` to populate a group, you would need to do additional work to put them back in their original location if that was the desired behavior.

Since grouping involves moving nodes to a different parent, this operation is subject to many reparenting restrictions:
