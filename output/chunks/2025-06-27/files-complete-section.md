Figma filesEvery file in Figma consists of a tree of nodes. At the root of every file is a DOCUMENT node, and from that node stems any CANVAS nodes. Every canvas node represents a PAGE in a Figma file. A canvas node can then have any number of nodes as its children. Each subtree stemming from a canvas node will represent a layer (e.g an object) on the canvas.

Nodes have a number of properties associated with them. Some of these are global properties, that exist on every node, whereas other node properties will be specific to the type of node.

Global propertiesThe following are properties that exist on every node. These give us some basic information about identifying and viewing the node.Node typePropertiesNodeidStringA string uniquely identifying this node within the document.nameStringThe name given to the node by the user in the tool.visibleBooleandefault: trueWhether or not the node is visible on the canvas.typeStringThe type of the node, refer to table below for details.rotationNumberThe rotation of the node, if not 0.pluginDataAnyData written by plugins that is visible only to the plugin that wrote it. Requires the `pluginData` to include the ID of the plugin.sharedPluginDataAnyData written by plugins that is visible to all plugins. Requires the `pluginData` parameter to include the string "shared".componentPropertyReferencesMap<String, String>A mapping of a layer's property to component property name of component properties attached to this node. The component property name can be used to look up more information on the corresponding component's or component set's componentPropertyDefinitions.boundVariablesMap<String, [VariableAlias](#variablealias-type)

[] | Map<String, [VariableAlias](#variablealias-type)
>>A mapping of field to the variables applied to this field. Most fields will only map to a single [ VariableAlias ](#variablealias-type)
 However, for fills, strokes, size, and component properties, it is possible to have multiple variables bound to the field.explicitVariableModesMap<String, String>A mapping of variable collection ID to mode ID representing the explicitly set modes for this node.Node typesNode type indicates what kind of node you are working with: for example, a FRAME node versus a RECTANGLE node. A node can have additional properties associated with it depending on its node type. The following is a catalog of properties that can be applied to a node, grouped by node type.Node typePropertiesDOCUMENTchildren[Node](#node-type)

[]EndpointsFiles endpoints allow for a wide range of functionality to get information about files. With a specific file key, you can get the JSON and image representations of the whole file or individual nodes within the file.

 GET file

Returns the document referred to by :key as a JSON object. The file key can be parsed from any Figma file url: https://www.figma.com/:file_type/:file_key/:file_name. The name, lastModified, thumbnailUrl, editorType, linkAccess, and version attributes are all metadata of the retrieved file. The document attribute contains a Node of type [DOCUMENT](#document-props)
.The components key contains a mapping from node IDs to component metadata. This is to help you determine which components each instance comes from.

Omitting this will get the current version of the fileidsStringoptionalComma separated list of nodes that you care about in the document. If specified, only a subset of the document will be returned corresponding to the nodes listed, their children, and everything between the root node and the listed nodes.Note: There may be other nodes included in the returned JSON that are outside the ancestor chains of the desired nodes. The response may also include dependencies of anything in the nodes' subtrees. For example, if a node subtree contains an instance of a local component that lives elsewhere in that file, that component and its ancestor chain will also be included.For historical reasons, top-level canvas nodes are always returned, regardless of whether they are listed in the ids parameter. This quirk may be removed in a future version of the API.depthNumberoptionalPositive integer representing how deep into the document tree to traverse. For example, setting this to 1 returns only Pages, setting it to 2 returns Pages and all top level objects on each page.

Any data present in the document written by those plugins will be included in the result in the `pluginData` and `sharedPluginData` properties.branch_dataBooleanoptionalReturns branch metadata for the requested file. If the file is a branch, the main file's key will be included in the returned response. If the file has branches, their metadata will be included in the returned response.

GET /v1/files/:key?depth=2GET file nodes

Returns the nodes referenced to by :ids as a JSON object. The nodes are retrieved from the Figma file referenced to by :key.The node id and file key can be parsed from any Figma node url: https://www.figma.com/:file_type/:file_key/:file_name?node-id=:id.The name, lastModified, thumbnailUrl, editorType, and version attributes are all metadata of the specified file.The linkAccess field describes the file link share permission level. There are 5 types of permissions a shared link can have: "inherit", "view", "edit", "org_view", and "org_edit". "inherit" is the default permission applied to files created in a team project, and will inherit the project's permissions. "org_view" and"org_edit" restrict the link to org users.The document attribute contains a Node of type [DOCUMENT](#document-props)
.The components key contains a mapping from node IDs to component metadata. This is to help you determine which components each instance comes from.By default, no vector data is returned. To return vector data, pass the geometry=paths parameter to the endpoint.Each node can also inherit properties from applicable styles. The styles key contains a mapping from style IDs to style metadata.Important: the nodes map may contain values that are null . This may be due to the node id not existing within the specified file.

Renders images from a file.If no error occurs, "images" will be populated with a map from node IDs to URLs of the rendered images, and "status" will be omitted. The image assets will expire after 30 days. Images up to 32 megapixels can be exported. Any images that are larger will be scaled down.Important: the image map may contain values that are null. This indicates that rendering of that specific node has failed. This may be due to the node id not existing, or other reasons such has the node having no renderable components. For example, a node that is invisible or has 0% opacity cannot be rendered. It is guaranteed that any node that was requested for rendering will be represented in this map whether or not the render succeeded.To render multiple images from the same file, use the ids query parameter to specify multiple node ids.GET /v1/images/:key?ids=1:2,1:3,1:4

Default: true.Rendering text elements as outlines guarantees that the text looks exactly the same in the SVG as it does in the browser/inside Figma.Exporting as <text> allows text to be selectable inside SVGs and generally makes the SVG easier to read. However, this relies on the browser's rendering engine which can vary between browsers and/or operating systems. As such, visual accuracy is not guaranteed as the result could look different than in Figma.svg_include_idBooleanoptionalWhether to include id attributes for all SVG elements. Adds the layer name to the id attribute of an svg element. Default: false.svg_include_node_idBooleanoptionalWhether to include node id attributes for all SVG elements.

Default: true.contents_onlyBooleanoptionalWhether content that overlaps the node should be excluded from rendering. Passing false (i.e., rendering overlaps) may increase processing time, since more of the document must be included in rendering.

Returns download links for all images present in image fills in a document. Image fills are how Figma represents any user supplied images. When you drag an image into Figma, we create a rectangle with a single fill that represents the image, and the user is able to transform the rectangle (and properties on the fill) as they wish.This endpoint returns a mapping from image references to the URLs at which the images may be download. Image URLs will expire after no more than 14 days. Image references are located in the output of the [GET files](#files-endpoint)
