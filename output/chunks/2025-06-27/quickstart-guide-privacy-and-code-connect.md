Figma only collects the minimum data needed to enable Code Connect in the interface. When you run `figma connect` using the Code Connect command-line interface, Figma gets the following data:

- The paths for components that are added
- The repository URL where the Code Connect components are implemented
- The properties and code in the .figma files

Figma logs only basic events for understanding Code Connect usage: when components are published or unpublished, and calls to get Figma data when using the command-line interface.

For more information about Figma's approach to privacy, see Figma's [Privacy Policy](https://www.figma.com/legal/privacy/)
