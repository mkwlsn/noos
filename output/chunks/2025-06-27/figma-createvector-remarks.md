By default, parented under `figma.currentPage`. Without setting additional properties, the vector has a bounding box but doesnâ€™t have any vertices. There are two ways to assign vertices to a vector node - [`vectorPaths`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/#vectorpaths)
 and [`setVectorNetworkAsync`](/plugin-docs/api/VectorNode/#setvectornetworkasync)
. Please refer to the documentation of those properties for more details.
